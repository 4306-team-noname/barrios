## Machine Learning
There may be a few ways to approach this project. After looking at the provided data and doing some research, machine learning seems to be a viable solution. Specifically, supervised machine learning that uses regression modeling. See the below introduction by Google.
- [Google - Intro to Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/intro-to-ml)
- [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - be sure to look at the prerequisites (NumPy, Pandas, etc., which we'll most likely need to use regardless of our approach)

If we decide to use ML, we should stick to some guidelines to make sure the project stays on track:
- [Google - Rules of Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml#rule_1_dont_be_afraid_to_launch_a_product_without_machine_learning)

Machine Learning offers some approaches and frameworks, but it will require a fair bit of study and experimentation to choose the correct method. It's worth mentioning that FB Prophet, which was Jeff's initial suggestion, was not a favorite among practitioners in the discussion thread.

- [M5 Forecasting Competition](https://www.innovating-automation.blog/m5-forecasting-competition/)

A couple of frameworks that were mentioned in the above discussion. We don't necessarily have to use these and, in fact, it might be a mistake to leap into one of these without a fundamental understanding of ML basics.
