|                |     historical consumable usage rate assumptions    |
|                |     and actual calculated usage rates in mission    |
|                |     time frames between resupply?                   |
|                |                                                     |
|                | 2.  What resupply quantities are necessary,         |
|                |     considering planned resupply vehicle traffic    |
|                |     from the ISS Flight Plan, planned On-Orbit Crew |
|                |     counts, and historical usage rates to sustain   |
|                |     minimum supply thresholds, plus a 10% safety    |
|                |     factor, through the next two years?             |

|                |     of question #2 while minimizing launch vehicle  |
|                |     quantity? (e.g., launching 10,000 granola bars  |
|                |     would ensure the minimum thresholds are not     |
|                |     violated, but is not a realistic or optimal     |
|                |     strategy for balancing launch mass requirements |
|                |     with supply requirements)                       |
|                |                                                     |

|                | 1.  What month in the next two years of the Flight  |
|                |     Plan timeline is most likely incur a violation  |
|                |     of minimum supply thresholds?                   |
|                |                                                     |
|                | 2.  Which consumables item(s) are most likely to    |
|                |     incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds  |
|                |     in the next two years of the future Flight Plan |
|                |     timeline?                                       |
