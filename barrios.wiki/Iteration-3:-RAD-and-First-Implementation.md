### First Implementation

- Give a summary of code developed for the first implementation. List the developed code structure (with subsystems), the names of the programs, and their functionality briefly explained (with links to the related program code on GitHub).

### Submission

1. In the **Wiki** pages of the repo, create a page named “**Iteration 3 - RAD and First Implementation**”. Submit all requirements (above) in this page.
2. Wiki text should be formatted using markdown. See: [Adam's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a few tips. Or https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md.
3. You will need to make a well-organized and readable wiki page.
4. Use [draw.io](http://draw.io) to draw UML Use Case Model, UML Class Diagrams (domain model) and Architecture, UML Sequence Diagram(s), UML State Chart Diagram(s).
7. Print the wiki page as PDF and upload to BB.
