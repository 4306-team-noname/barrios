Here are the steps for the final submission of the projects:

A) First, update your wiki pages at your project GitHub area.

B) The first page at the wiki should give a brief description of the project, team members and information about the course (semester, university, etc.). Then, it should be followed by links to RAD (Iteration 3), RDD (Iteration 4), Installation, and User Manual pages. Each one of these should be a page in wiki. Take the pdf output of these pages as follows and upload to Bb.

1. **rad.pdf**: Update and revise the original RAD to reflect the final software system
1. **sdd.pdf**: Update and revise the original SDD to reflect the final software system.
1. **installation.pdf**: In this document you will report the following: Cover; Introduction (short description of the project); Software (list the modules/programs, their purpose and report which team members developed those parts as a table); Installation Instructions (explain the steps for how to install and run the system)
1. **user_manual.pdf**: A document detailing how the software should be used.
1. **presentation.pdf**: Project presentation slides.

C) **Code**: Your code section in GitHub should be complete and clean with subdirectories as subsystems, and all code is clean and commented.

D) **Project on GitHub**: You project page on GitHub should have all the to-do items clean, all done items should list completed tasks, and nothing in progress-list.

Project presentation outline:

* Team (1 slide)
* Application short description (1 slide)
* Functional requirements (1 slide) (all should be done by the software)
* Use case model (1 slide)
* Subsystems (1 slide)
* Class diagram (1 slide)
* Data management (1 slide)
* GitHub (1 slide): source code structure, who developed what part, how many lines of code.
* Demo (of your software)

Reserve 15 minutes for slide presentation and 10-15 minutes for demo.
