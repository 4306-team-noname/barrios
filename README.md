## Project Requirements
**Focus**

> Remember the following prompts for analysis, and center all of the effort around deriving insights into these prompts:
> Questions:
> 1. __Analysis__ (?)
> What is the percent difference between historical consumable usage rate assumptions and actual calculated usage rates in mission time frames between resupply?
> 2. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities are necessary, considering planned resupply vehicle traffic from the ISS Flight Plan, planned On-Orbit Crew counts, and historical usage rates to sustain minimum supply thresholds, plus a 10% safety factor, through the next two years?
> 3. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities meet the requirements of question \#2 while minimizing launch vehicle quantity? (e.g., launching 10,000 granola bars would ensure the minimum thresholds are not violated, but is not a realistic or optimal strategy for balancing launch mass requirements with supply requirements)
> 4. __Predictive modeling__
> What month in the next two years of the Flight Plan timeline is most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds?
> 5. __Predictive modeling__
> Which consumables item(s) are most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds in the next two years of the future Flight Plan timeline?

## Development Guidelines

All major development will be completed in this repository. While you are encouraged to explore and code in the DevContainer provided by Jeff, class requirements for project iterations require that each member of the team commit code to the repository. So, you need to know how to use Git and GitHub at a basic level.

> [!NOTE]
> The following commands assume you're working in a Linux environment. On a Windows machine, you should execute them in WSL or with the Git terminal for Windows

To contribute to this repository, you need to first clone it to your local machine. The easiest way to do this is in a terminal.

Navigate to a directory on your machine where you prefer to store your code. For me, that's `~/dev/projects`, it may be different for you. I'm just going to refer to it as the `projects` from now on.

```bash
cd ~/dev/projects
```

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4306-team-noname/barrios.git
```

To be continued...

## Github flow
1. __Create a new branch__. You can do this in VS Code through the version control panel. Click the three dots, then `Branch > Create Branch`. Give it a name that either indicates what feature you're working on, or what issue number you're addressing. For this example, let's pretend we're creating a branch called `my-feature-branch`.
2. __Publish the branch__. Once the branch is created, the name of the branch you're working on should be changed in the version control panel. Instead of `main` it will say `my-feature-branch`. The big button at the bottom of the panel will probably say `Publish Branch`. Click the button to add your branch to the remote repository.
3. __Do work, make commits, push__. Do some work in your branch! Make commits, push code, etc. When you're all done, push your code one more time.
4. __Make a pull request__. Okay, this sounds weird but a "Pull Request" is different that `git pull`. Pull requests are a GitHub feature, not a git feature. So, open your browser and head to GitHub. Navigate to [the barrios repo](https://github.com/4306-team-noname/barrios) and click on the link above the code that says `n branches` (where `n` is the number of branches). That will take you to a page that has all the active branches. Find your branch and click the `New pull request` button.
