## Resources

There may be a few ways to approach this project. After looking at the provided data and doing some research, machine learning seems to be a viable solution. Specifically, supervised machine learning that uses regression modeling. See the below introduction by Google.
- [Google - Intro to Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/intro-to-ml)

If we decide to use ML, we should stick to some guidelines to make sure the project stays on track:
- [Google - Rules of Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml#rule_1_dont_be_afraid_to_launch_a_product_without_machine_learning)

Machine Learning offers some approaches and frameworks, but it will require a fair bit of study and experimentation to choose the correct method. It's worth mentioning that FB Prophet, which was Jeff's initial suggestion, was not a favorite among practitioners in the discussion thread.

- [M5 Forecasting Competition](https://www.innovating-automation.blog/m5-forecasting-competition/)

A couple of frameworks that were mentioned in the above discussion. We don't necessarily have to use these and, in fact, it might be a mistake to leap into one of these without a fundamental understanding of ML basics.
