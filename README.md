## Project Requirements
**Focus**

> Remember the following prompts for analysis, and center all of the effort around deriving insights into these prompts:
> Questions:
> 1. __Analysis__ (?)
> What is the percent difference between historical consumable usage rate assumptions and actual calculated usage rates in mission time frames between resupply?
> 2. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities are necessary, considering planned resupply vehicle traffic from the ISS Flight Plan, planned On-Orbit Crew counts, and historical usage rates to sustain minimum supply thresholds, plus a 10% safety factor, through the next two years?
> 3. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities meet the requirements of question \#2 while minimizing launch vehicle quantity? (e.g., launching 10,000 granola bars would ensure the minimum thresholds are not violated, but is not a realistic or optimal strategy for balancing launch mass requirements with supply requirements)
> 4. __Predictive modeling__
> What month in the next two years of the Flight Plan timeline is most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds?
> 5. __Predictive modeling__
> Which consumables item(s) are most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds in the next two years of the future Flight Plan timeline?

## Development Guidelines
See the [guidelines](docs/guidelines.md) guidance on how to work with Git and GitHub.

## Running the development application

### Prerequisites
You need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer for everything to work properly. Both can probably be obtained by installing `Docker Desktop`.

## Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

Run these three commands from the top-level `barrios` directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate #  Windows
source .venv/bin/activate #  Mac/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start Docker images

Start `docker-compose` from the root directory of the application (i.e. `barrios/`).

```bash
docker-compose up
```
This will pull the necessary docker images and set them up so you have a PostgreSQL server and a PGAdmin server running.

#### Set up the database through PGAdmin
1. __Connect to the database server with PGAdmin__
   1. 1. In a browser, navigate to `localhost:5050` (or `http://127.0.0.1:50`, if you're feeling verbose). This will open a setup page for PGAdmin. It will ask you to set a master password. Set it to whatever you want.
   2. In `Quick Links` on the front page, click `Add New Server`.
   3. On the tab labeled `General`, set the `Name` to `postgres`.
   4. In the `Connection` tab, set the `Host name/address` to `postgres` the username to `postgres`, and the password to `changeme`. You can toggle `Save password` if you want.
   5. Click `Save`
2. __Set up the database user__
   1. This will add the `postgres` server you loaded from the docker container. In the left sidebar, click `Servers`, then `postgres` to expand the menu.
   2. Right-click on `Login/Group Roles`, then choose `Create > Login/Group Role...`
   3. In the `General` tab, set the name to `barrios`.
   4.  In the `Definition` tab, set the password to `barrios123`
   5.  In the `Privileges` tab, turn on `Can log in?`
   6.  Click `Save`
3.  __Add the database__
    1.  In the left sidebar, under `postgres`, right-click on `Databases` and select `Create > Database...`
    2.  In the `General` tab, set the `Database` to `barrios`, and the `Owner` to `barrios`
    3.  Click `Save`

#### Create a superuser and seed the database

1. Make sure you're in the `server/barrios` directory. You're going to need to run one script and one Django command. Before running the script, you may need to make sure that you have the correct permissions to do so. If you're on Windows, navigate to the directory using `GitBash`. If you're on Linux, just navigate to the directory using a terminal. Then, run this command to change the script's permissions:

```bash
chmod 775 resetdb.sh
```

  I don't use Windows, so I honestly don't know if the above is necessary (nor do I know if it will even do anything). It's required for Linux, though.

2. Open the script in a text editor and change the `ADMIN_EMAIL` variable. This isn't necessarily required unless you're testing out the application's email capabilities (reset password, etc).

3. Run the script with the command `./resetdb.sh`. It will ask you if you want to proceed. Type `yes`. The script will then attempt to drop all of the data from an existing `barrios` database and reset all of the tables so they match the application's models. When it's done, it will prompt you for a password.

4. Now, it's time to seed the database with the Barrios data. Copy everything except ` inventory_mgmt_system_consumables_20220101-20230905_header.csv` from the Barrios dataset into `server/barrios/media/seed_data` (that file has no header and I'm still trying to figure out how to properly rewrite it so it's usable).

5. From the `server/barrios` directory, run the following command to seed the database with the Barrios data:

```bash
python manage.py init_data
```
It will list all of the files being loaded. If there are any errors, or any files don't match expected data types, it will tell you. If everything went well, it will output:

```
11 of 11 files were saved to the database successfully.
All data loaded successfully!
ðŸ™­ Good luck out there!
```

### Start the server

Now that the setup is all out of the way, it's time to start the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

That will start the server on port `8000`. Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`. You should be presented with a screen that has nothing but the Barrios logo and a link to the login page. Follow the link and use the admin username/password you just created to login.

Have fun!
