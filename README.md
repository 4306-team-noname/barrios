## Project Requirements
**Focus**

> Remember the following prompts for analysis, and center all of the effort around deriving insights into these prompts:
> Questions:
> 1. __Analysis__ (?)
> What is the percent difference between historical consumable usage rate assumptions and actual calculated usage rates in mission time frames between resupply?
> 2. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities are necessary, considering planned resupply vehicle traffic from the ISS Flight Plan, planned On-Orbit Crew counts, and historical usage rates to sustain minimum supply thresholds, plus a 10% safety factor, through the next two years?
> 3. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities meet the requirements of question \#2 while minimizing launch vehicle quantity? (e.g., launching 10,000 granola bars would ensure the minimum thresholds are not violated, but is not a realistic or optimal strategy for balancing launch mass requirements with supply requirements)
> 4. __Predictive modeling__
> What month in the next two years of the Flight Plan timeline is most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds?
> 5. __Predictive modeling__
> Which consumables item(s) are most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds in the next two years of the future Flight Plan timeline?
