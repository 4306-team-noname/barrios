## Project Requirements
**Focus**

> Remember the following prompts for analysis, and center all of the effort around deriving insights into these prompts:
> Questions:
> 1. __Analysis__ (?)
> What is the percent difference between historical consumable usage rate assumptions and actual calculated usage rates in mission time frames between resupply?
> 2. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities are necessary, considering planned resupply vehicle traffic from the ISS Flight Plan, planned On-Orbit Crew counts, and historical usage rates to sustain minimum supply thresholds, plus a 10% safety factor, through the next two years?
> 3. __Optimization__
> What resupply quantities meet the requirements of question \#2 while minimizing launch vehicle quantity? (e.g., launching 10,000 granola bars would ensure the minimum thresholds are not violated, but is not a realistic or optimal strategy for balancing launch mass requirements with supply requirements)
> 4. __Predictive modeling__
> What month in the next two years of the Flight Plan timeline is most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds?
> 5. __Predictive modeling__
> Which consumables item(s) are most likely to incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds in the next two years of the future Flight Plan timeline?

## Development Guidelines
See the [guidelines](docs/guidelines.md) guidance on how to work with Git and GitHub.

## Running the development application

### Prerequisites
You need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer for everything to work properly. Both can probably be obtained by installing `Docker Desktop`.

## Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

Run these three commands from the top-level `barrios` directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate #  Windows
source .venv/bin/activate #  Mac/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start Docker images

Start `docker-compose` from the root directory of the application (i.e. `barrios/`).

```bash
docker-compose up
```
This will pull the necessary docker images and set them up so you have a PostgreSQL server and a PGAdmin server running.

#### Set up the database through PGAdmin
1. __Connect to the database server with PGAdmin__
   1. 1. In a browser, navigate to `localhost:5050` (or `http://127.0.0.1:50`, if you're feeling verbose). This will open a setup page for PGAdmin. It will ask you to set a master password. Set it to whatever you want.
   2. In `Quick Links` on the front page, click `Add New Server`.
   3. On the tab labeled `General`, set the `Name` to `postgres`.
   4. In the `Connection` tab, set the `Host name/address` to `postgres` the username to `postgres`, and the password to `changeme`. You can toggle `Save password` if you want.
   5. Click `Save`
2. __Set up the database user__
   1. This will add the `postgres` server you loaded from the docker container. In the left sidebar, click `Servers`, then `postgres` to expand the menu.
   2. Right-click on `Login/Group Roles`, then choose `Create > Login/Group Role...`
   3. In the `General` tab, set the name to `barrios`.
   4.  In the `Definition` tab, set the password to `barrios123`
   5.  In the `Privileges` tab, turn on `Can log in?`
   6.  Click `Save`
3.  __Add the database__
    1.  In the left sidebar, under `postgres`, right-click on `Databases` and select `Create > Database...`
    2.  In the `General` tab, set the `Database` to `barrios`, and the `Owner` to `barrios`
    3.  Click `Save`

#### Populate the database tables
1. Now it's time to create the database tables. Django provides a mechanism for doing that based on models that have been created in the project. Back in the terminal, navigate to `server/barrios` in the top-level project folder and run two commands:
   ```bash
    cd server/barrios
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Create an admin user

Now that the database has been created, you need to have an admin user to test different parts of the application. Django provides a command for that. Run the following and follow the prompts to create an admin user:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Start the server

Now that the setup is all out of the way, it's time to start the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

That will start the server on port `8000`. Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`. You should be presented with a screen that has nothing but the Barrios logo and a link to the login page. Follow the link and use the admin username/password you just created to login.

Have fun!
