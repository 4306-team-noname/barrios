# Exploratory Data Analysis

To activate the Virtual Environment:
source venv/Scripts/activate

EDA_test.py is a way to take one of the .csv files and begin the exploratory data analysis.
The Data Visualization is still being worked on, because I'm not sure how to read the data with the plugins seaborn and matplotlib
