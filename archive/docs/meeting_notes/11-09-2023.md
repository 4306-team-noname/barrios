# Barrios meeting notes

## Thursday, November 9, 2023

Largely we should only be concerned with items owned by NASA.
- Some food items and some space toilet hardware is owned by RSA. If we want to distinguish between the two we can approach it that way but we don't have to blanketly exclude RSA.

- Filter by data that's newer than 2022 is ok.

- If you can use the fields within the dataset such as launch and move date to determine when an item may have arrived or departed, that can certainly be useful. But another way we can look at it.

- Do a query to sum all of the items for a given launch/move date. That way you're not trying to track individual items and their movement through different statuses but instead you're tracking the aggregate of, for example, 100 granola bars.

- Every item in the "stored items only" is in storage

- `tree` can be marked as stored, trash, or return!

- `datedim` may not refer to the query alone! Devin says we can use `datedim` to track an item's existence on the space station.

- `sum` and `groupby('datedim')`

- `SELECT *, SUM(COUNT('id')) GROUP BY 'datedim'` -- example given by Devin in the meeting when asked about tracking an item through the IMS using the `datedim` field.
