<td><strong>Project Description</strong></td>
<td><p>Barrios.io is a branch of Barrios Technology that brings modern
data solutions to your industry, wherever you are. Input data, output
value. We offer our expertise to reduce data sprawl and make your data
processes valuable and profitable. Our data specialists seek to empower
teams with database design, creation, and management, procedural data
updates, and business intelligence standards, such as dynamic and
responsive visualizations, interactive reporting, Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), alerts and monitoring, parameters inputs, data
forecasting and trending, and more.</p>
<p>Barrios.io is seeking to work with talented students across the areas
of Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Project Management, and Business
Management on a diverse and flexible selection of real-world problems
that benefit university students at multiple levels while bringing value
to Barrios.io and our government and commercial space exploration
industry.</p>
<p><strong>Project Mission Statement:</strong></p>
<p>Evaluate and provide insights and predictions into consumable usage
rates, resupply logistics constraints, and previous projection accuracy
based on ISS vehicle traffic schedule, crew compliment, minimum supply
thresholds, and historical supply actuals.</p>
<p><strong>Objective Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to assess historical data regarding
the above ISS parameters and consumables supply to derive historical
insights and prescribe predictive outcomes to minimize risks to mission
success, refine usage rate assumptions, and identify upcoming logistics
challenges in the strategic planning timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sets:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>ISS Inventory Management System (IMS) historical data for the
last two years as relates to Consumables items. To be cleared for public
release.</p></li>
<li><p>ISS Flight Plan historical data for the last two years and the
next two years. To be cleared for public release.</p></li>
<li><p><mark>Human Space Flight Technical Integration Contract (HSFTIC)
Consumables Analysis Business Rules</mark></p></li>
<li><p><mark>Historical Actuals derived from Mission Control Center
(MCC) Gateway Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS)
Tracker</mark></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Historical data used for analysis should be limited to Jan.
1<sup>st</sup>, <mark>2022</mark> and onward.</p></li>
<li><p>Barrios will provide clean, structured data sets with
accompanying data dictionaries</p></li>
<li><p>Barrios will meet with class (either virtually or in-person) at
the beginning of the semester/term to provide an overview on the ISS and
the relevant data sets, questions, predictive modeling challenges, and
deliverables</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to data analysis insights and predictive model
outcomes, ASU students will document data manipulation processes,
software implementation details, and solution architecture to provide
robust deliverable reports that satisfy the key components listed in
Final Deliverables section below</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is the percent difference between historical consumable
usage rate assumptions and actual calculated usage rates in mission time
frames between resupply?</p></li>
<li><p>What resupply quantities are necessary, considering planned
resupply vehicle traffic from the ISS Flight Plan, planned On-Orbit Crew
counts, and historical usage rates to sustain minimum supply thresholds,
plus a 10% safety factor, through the next two years?</p></li>
<li><p>What resupply quantities meet the requirements of question #2
while minimizing launch vehicle quantity? (e.g., launching 10,000
granola bars would ensure the minimum thresholds are not violated, but
is not a realistic or optimal strategy for balancing launch mass
requirements with supply requirements)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Predictive modeling:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What month in the next two years of the Flight Plan timeline is
most likely incur a violation of minimum supply thresholds?</p></li>
<li><p>Which consumables item(s) are most likely to incur a violation of
minimum supply thresholds in the next two years of the future Flight
Plan timeline?</p></li>
</ol></td>
