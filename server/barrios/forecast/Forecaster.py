    Abstract class for a forecaster

    Note
    ----
    Implementation code for this class would have been located in the
    prototypes directory, however the teammate enlisted to write the code
    did not do so. As such, this class is a placeholder.

    Basic implementation code can be found in this directory within `create_forecast.py`
    and `create_forecast_chart.py`.
