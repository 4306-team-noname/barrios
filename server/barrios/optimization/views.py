# Okay, here's the plan:
# 1. Load a grid of missions to display on index.
#   - Each mission consists of:
#       - vehicle name
#       - launch date
#       - dock date
#       - Consumables/amounts table
# 2. Optimization form allows user to select a specific consumable
#    and sends a request to generate a single optimization for that item.
#    - Request's response is a chart showing how much of a given
#      consumable to ship on each launch date. The chart should include
#      thresholds ... I'm not sure what else. Considering that the optimization
#      will rely on calculated actual rates, it will essentially be a forecast
#      chart.
